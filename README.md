# Lua-Projects
Lua Repo , For Scripting and Game Dev


Welcome to my Lua scripting journey! This repository contains a growing collection of mini-projects, scripts, and game experiments written in Lua. Whether it's learning the syntax, building logic, or making full games — it's all here.

## 📘 About Me

I'm self-teaching Lua with the goal of building cool games and automations. Every folder here marks a step in my learning curve — from basic "Hello World" scripts to fully playable games using Lua-based engines like Love2D.

## 🔧 Projects Overview

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01_hello_lua/` | My very first Lua script — the classic Print() |
